                    <p className="real-des-sub">Our thermoelectric cooling technology has already demonstrated its effectiveness in demanding applications, such as achieving thermal comfort in lift cabins. We deliver tangible results in temperature reduction and energy savings. Performance data shows stable operation even under fluctuating load conditions, where conventional compressor systems often lose efficiency. The solid-state architecture also reduces maintenance requirements due to fewer moving parts, improving long-term reliability and lifecycle cost predictability.</p>
